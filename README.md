It's time to build our first 2D game! I hope you enjoy this project.

We will get started like we did with project 03:

On your GitHub account, go to Repositories and click the green "New" button
You should be on the "Create a new repository" form
You are the owner of this repository; make the Repository name: 05-Space-shooter
Add a description for this project
The repository should be left Public
Initialize this repository with a README
Add .gitignore (select Python)
Add a license: MIT License
Then hit the green "Create repository" button
You now have a fresh repository! Clone the new repository in VS Code (like we have in the past), and then open the new repository
In the File Explorer view, you should see a line that reads 05-Space-shooter. If you hover your mouse over that line, several icons should appear. The icon on the left should allow you to create a new file
Name the new file: main.py
This will be the main file for your project
If you need a place to get started, you can look at the updated template.py file at my new Project-template repository (Links to an external site.)
Feel free to start collecting some 2D assets from https://kenny.nl (Links to an external site.) or https://opengameart.org. (Links to an external site.)
The purpose of this project is to create a 2D space shooter game. To score 18 points, you will need to have a ship that is controlled by the player (mouse or keyboard). Your game will need to have enemies or obstacles. You will need to have a scoring system. Weapons and bullets, levels, etc. are optional (but can be a source of additional points).

Don't panic! We will be working through the creation of this code in class. You will also have a chance to expand and extend the code.

When you are satisfied with your efforts. Commit (and push) your changes to GitHub, and turn in the URL to your repository on Canvas.
