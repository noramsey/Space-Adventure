Project: Space shooter
Peer's repository:  https://github.com/noramsey/Space-Adventure.git



What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?
I thought that making the space ship invisivle is good idea to make the space shooter
 

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
Like I said at the previous one, making some item which makes the space ship invisible
and take out collision at that time.
 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
when I played, I saw that his/her bullets went through the enemy.  I assume there was no collision there
so if this could have collision, that would look nicer.

What could have been clearer or better commented?
I thought if s/he could have actual spaceship on the screen, that would be clearer
 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?
not really
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
yes it does
 

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
I think the README was fine
 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
His/her project's background was clear and the character looked nice.   As README said 
this project as done as s/he could get.  Great work!
